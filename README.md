This app uses Node, Express, Typescript,  MongoDB, and Mongoose. Make sure to do an npm install to get access to all of the necessary node modules as well as create your own gitignore.

## Usage
To begin, in your terminal type npm run dev. This will build the database, seed it with data, and connect it to the server. Once this is complete, pull up your Insomnia (or comparable program) for testing.
